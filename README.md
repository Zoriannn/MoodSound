Revolutionizing mental health diagnostics, our project harnesses the wealth of Spotify's music library and employs advanced technology to predict mental health conditions based on individual music preferences. Traditional methods often fall short due to their heavy reliance on self-reporting or predictions, leading to accuracy issues and challenges in early detection, personalized treatment, and accessibility to mentorship.

Our innovative approach aims to bridge these gaps by identifying potential correlations between music preferences and mental health conditions. By analyzing specific songs or genres that influence an individual's mental well-being, we can offer personalized insights and recommendations. This not only enhances early detection and intervention but also provides mental health professionals with a valuable tool for conducting assessments and developing tailored treatment plans.

The system's integration with mental health support is a pivotal feature. Mental health professionals can leverage the model's predictions to enhance the accuracy of their assessments, leading to more effective treatment planning. This collaborative approach ensures that individuals receive the support they need, tailored to their unique circumstances and preferences.

In essence, our project strives to transform mental health diagnostics by leveraging the power of music data. This innovative method addresses the limitations of traditional approaches, offering a more accurate, personalized, and accessible solution. By understanding the intricate connections between music preferences and mental well-being, we envision a future where mental health interventions are not only more effective but also deeply attuned to the individual needs of each person.
